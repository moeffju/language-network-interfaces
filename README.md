# Atom syntax for /etc/network/interfaces

This package adds basic syntax highlighting for `/etc/network/interfaces` (and `interfaces.d/*` if you like). Since the file uses no extension, you might have to manually choose the syntax.

If you want to customize the colors, please see `grammars/network-interfaces.cson` for the token names used.
